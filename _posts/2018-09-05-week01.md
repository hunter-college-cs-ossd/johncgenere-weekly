# Contributing to OpenStreetMap
I wasn't expecting to find many locations that had not been updated and/or never added, but I was very wrong. There is 
a mini outlet mall near my home and basically nothing had been added or updated. I added the name, address, and hours 
of operation to a few different stores such as Starbucks, AT&T, etc. While I was working on the assignment, I was in 
Williamsburg and decided to look around and I saw that Martha's Bakery's location was in the wrong place and updated it. 
In the link below you will be able to see these changes.

I believe this to have been the best introduction into the open source world. There was no coding. There was no overly
complicated and layered process. Instead, there was the concept of attempting to contribute to a project in a way that 
you feel would enhance the project as a whole. I say attempting because just like any open-source project, your contribution
must be approved by someone before your contribution is made public. I felt like as if this was the softball version 
of open-source, you get the whole experience without the coding aspect.
