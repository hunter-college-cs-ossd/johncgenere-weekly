# Contributing to OpenStreetMap
I wasn't expecting to find many locations that had not been updated and/or never added, but I was very wrong. There is 
a mini outlet mall near my home and basically nothing had been added or updated. I added the name, address, and hours 
of operation to a few different stores such as Starbucks, AT&T, etc. While I was working on the assignment, I was in 
Williamsburg and decided to look around and I saw that Martha's Bakery's location was in the wrong place and updated it. 
In the link below you will be able to see these changes.
