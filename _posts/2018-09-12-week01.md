# Assignment 1: Contributing to OpenStreetMap
I was expecting to not find a lot of locations that had not been updated and/or never added,
but I was very wrong. There is a mini outlet mall near my home and basically nothing had been 
added or updated. I added the name, address, and hours of operation to a few different stores
such as Starbucks, AT&T, etc. While I was working on the assignment, I was in Williamsburg and
decided to look around and I saw that Martha's Bakery's location was in the wrong place and 
updated it. In the link below you will be able to see these changes.
