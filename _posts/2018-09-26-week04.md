# Git Workflow Assignment

I always feel like anything that is new to me is hard, as it naturally should be since it is something that I have never done before but then with some practice I get better at it. This Git excerice was no different, at first I was confused since I never worked with it before but then some tutorials and a few readings later I got the hang of it. After utilizing it on my own system, I immediately found it very useful when working on my own programming project. 

# Blog 09/26/2018
Before this assignment, we were tasked with reading up on Git and how to use it. I am thankful I did the readings because as stated above this blog section, I was completely unaware of how to use Git. To be quite honest at the beginning of the readings, I remember being rather unimpressed with Git; it didn't quite grab my attention. The more I read and then put what I read into practice, the more and more I understood how useful it was.
