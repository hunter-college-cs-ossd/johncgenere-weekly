# Readings on Open Source (Part 2)

For this assignment, we were tasked with reading articles and sections of textbooks regarding how to contribute to an open-source project. The readings were:

- [A Beginner's Very Bumpy Journey Through The World of Open Source by Shubheksha Jalan](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/a-beginners-very-bumpy-journey-through-the-world-of-open-source-4d108d540b39)
- [How to Contribute to Open Source Without Coding by Craig Buchek](https://icontribute.wordpress.com/how-to-contribute-to-open-source-without-coding/)
- [GitHub's Guide to How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to)
- [Producing Open Source Software, 2nd edition by Karl Fogel (pages 62-69)](https://producingoss.com/)
