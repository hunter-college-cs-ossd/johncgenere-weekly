# A Second Git Workflow Exercise

For this assignment, we were given another Git Workflow exercise; but in this exercise we had to deal with merge conflicts. 
This was a group assignment, each group had 4-5 people (mine had 4) and the assignment was designed to have each person 
in their group do a pull request to every other person in their group. This eventually led to some merge conflicts which had 
to be resolved. I personally didn't find much difficulty on solving these merge conflicts but I did find it interesting how 
multiple contributions from different individuals to a file can happen with relative ease.

Honestly, I felt like if the situation was different in terms of groups and how we communicated, this assignment could have gotten more difficult. Since my group was in constant contact with each other, we took turns with our pull request to avoid even more merge conflicts. I can definitely see how a project with a large number of contributors can become chaotic since, in reality, there isn't much communication when a pull request happens; it just happens.
