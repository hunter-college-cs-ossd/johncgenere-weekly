# A Second Git Workflow Exercise

For this assignment, we were given another Git Workflow exercise; but in this exercise we had to deal with merge conflicts. 
This was a group assignment, each group had 4-5 people (mine had 4) and the assignment was designed to have each person 
in their group do a pull request to every other person in their group. This eventually led to some merge conflicts which had 
to be resolved. I personally didn't find much difficulty on solving these merge conflicts but I did find it interesting how 
multiple contributions from different individuals to a file can happen with relative ease.
