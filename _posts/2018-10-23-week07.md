This week has been pretty eventful and insightful. Eventful because I have started to look into possible
open-source projects that I would like to work on. I honestly don't know what type of project I am looking
for, but if I find something that will solve a personal issue of mine I will be inclined to work on it. This 
week has been insightful because I learned about bug trackers through an exercise via the Bugzilla bug tracker. 
It showed me how bugs are categorized as well as who has been working on bugs and who has been issuing bug 
reports, both are super important because they essentially tell you who is actively working on the project.
