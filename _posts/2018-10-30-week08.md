Unfortunately, there is not much of an update for this week as I am still looking for a potential
open-source project that I would like to work on. The current assignment that is a due in a couple
of days has helped me in this process because I am evaluating three different open-source projects
which in effect has taught me how to find the ideal open-source project. By ideal I mean one that 
not only is active but has a friendly community as well so that a newcomer like myself won't be 
discouraged by any harsh replies.
