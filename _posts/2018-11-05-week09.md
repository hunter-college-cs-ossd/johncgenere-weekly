#### Do maintainers respond quickly to issues when they are opened?
I wouldn't say quickly, there's many open issues from a month ago that have had no updates.
#### Is there active discussion on the issues?
There is active discussion on some of the issues but not all of the issues.
#### Are the issues recent?
Yes and no. Yes because there's a lot of issues opened a month back and before that are relatively close to each other
in terms of time of creation but no because I see no new issues within the past 3-4 weeks. I am not sure if the list is
not updated on their website but that's what is there currently.
#### Are issues getting closed?
Yes, issues are getting closed seemingly everyday.
#### How many open pull requests are there?
There are currently 32 open pull requests.
#### Do maintainers respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened?
Yes maintainers do respond quickly to pull requests when they are opened. From the few pages of closed pull request it
seems that they often reply within the day if not a couple of day.
#### Is there active discussion on the pull requests?

pull requests.

## Assessing the Welcomeness
#### Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive?
Yes they are helpful in the sense that they tell you if the bug reported has been fixed in a new version but
there's not much if any constructive feedback from what I saw.
#### Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?
For the most part yes, but what is typically seen is something along the lines of "this is not a bug..." or 
"this was fixed in..." when I think it could be rephrased to be more friendly to the person adding what they 
believe to be an issue. 
#### Do pull requests get reviewed?
Pull requests do get reviewed as I see that not many pull request are stale in the sense that no one has looked at it. 
For the most part, almost all pull request have a short shelf life if any at all which is great.
#### Do maintainers thank people for their contributions?
They do not, but a part of me believes as this is how I would feel, that the merging of ones pull request is a thank
you.

## Assessing the Welcomeness
#### Do the maintainers respond helpfully to questions in issues? Are responses generally constructive?
The maintainer do respond helpfully and with great detail to questions. Not only that but they are constructive 
in regards to their project and any other project on Github (i.e. advices users to open issues with correct information
to avoid getting bad feedback from those are not so nice).
#### Are people friendly in the issues, discussion forum, and chat?
They are very friendly and seemlingly appreciative. 
#### Do pull requests get reviewed?
Not all of them but a good amount of them do, which is not ideal but it is certainly better than none. I would like

Yes they do!
