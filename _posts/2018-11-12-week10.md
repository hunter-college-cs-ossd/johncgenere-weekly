# Setting Up A Project

The Open-Source Project that I will be working on is **CKB-Next**, it is an RBG Driver for Linux and Mac.
This is a project that I am genuinely interested in because like it was said in "The Cathedral and the Bazaar" 
by Eric Raymond, "Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch". CKB-Next
solves a personal itch I have had for a few months now with no idea how to scratch it. Before I was introduced 
to CKB-Next, my Corsair K95 keyboard has had its default multi-colored spiral effect that after a short time can
get rather annoying and distracting. This does not occur on Windows because Corsair has a driver that can be 
downloaded to control the colors and effects, Corsair does not provide a similar driver for Linux. Once I
installed CKB-Next on to my Linux machine, I was immediately pleased to see that I could change the colors and
the effects with ease. Now, I want to see if there is anyway in which I can help to this wonderful project that
has solved one of my personal issues. The installation of the development environment was rather smooth, there
was no conflicts during this process. I compiled and ran it on my local machine to ensure that it works fine, which
it thankfully does.
