## CKB-Next Progress
As a group, we had decided that our contribution was to make the application dark-mode compatible on macOS. We decided to try to implement this because its level of difficulty was low enough where we can do it but high enough where the solution wasn't easy to find. We ended up scrapping this idea because we came to the realization that the app was already dark-mode compatible, we believe that this is not the doing of the app it self but rather from the OS. 

After this realization, we found an issue that had not been resolved and also label "good first issue" which is essentially labeled so that rookies like myself can take a crack at it and actually have a chance at solving it.

[Here is the issue](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/issues/58)

We have decided to stick with this issue and attempt to solve it. We have made some progress on it but nothing complete, hopefully, we will reach a point at which our solution can be merged.
