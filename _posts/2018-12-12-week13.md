# Software Licenses
### What is Copyleft?
- Copyleft is a general method for making a program free software and requiring all modified and extended versions of the program to be free software as well.
- Copyleft says that anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it. Copyleft guarantees that every user has freedom.

Essentially, the program will never at any point in time will be made proprietary. 

### What is permissive?
- A "permissive" license is simply a non-copyleft open source license â€” one that guarantees the freedoms to use, modify, and redistribute, but that permits proprietary derivative works. 

Basically, a permissive license is a license that allows the distribution of modified work or derivative work. Which is why
it non-copyleft because it is similar to copyleft with the exception of granting permission to distribute derivative work.

### Creative Commons Licenses and Software 
Creative Commons licenses are not ideal for use with software because they do not contain specific terms about the distribution
of source code, which is often important in ensuring the freedom to use and modify said software. Also, Creative Commons(CC)
licenses are currently not compatible with the major software licenses, so trying to integrate work that has a CC license with
other free software may become rather difficult.
