# Farewell
This past semester has been extremely insightful for me personally. I had never worked on Git or even GitHub and this
class basically opened the door for me. As the semester dwindles down, my group has been working on getting our pull
request merged in CKB-Next and so far... nothing. Well not nothing, just not merge quite yet. We got in contact with 
the projects most frequent contributor, "tatokis" and boy did that help us a lot. Essentially in our attempt to solve, 
well add the feature requested we sort of... kind of... created memory leaks. Also, our change to the tray icon would
revert back to the original one if one were to close the application and open it again. 

We went back and made the changes necessary and took every piece of advice that was given to us. The issues that were there
before are no longer there in the latest version of our feature addition now all that was left to do is try again. 

[Here Is The Link To Our Pull Request](https://github.com/ckb-next/ckb-next/pull/308)

It was so nice to be able to talk to someone who basically knows the project so well, they were able to tell us available 
workarounds to make things easier on us and explained it in a way where it was easy to follow. 

With that being said, this class was great and let's hope our pull request gets merged!
